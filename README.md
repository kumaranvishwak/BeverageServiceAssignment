# JAX-RS REST API - SOA Assignment 1

Implement a beverage store as specified in the assignment description.
Your project must be buildable with gradle (the easiest way to achieve this is using this template).
The server is available at [localhost:9999/v1](http://localhost:9999/v1) per default. 
This can be configured via `src/main/resources/config.properties`.
 
To discover the different resources, methods and data schemas use the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/#) and the `openapi.yaml` file.
Also include a swagger UI resource to enable displaying swagger UI as in our demo project.

## Artefacts, you have to submit
- Source Code
- openapi.yaml
- bruno.json / bruno collection directory
